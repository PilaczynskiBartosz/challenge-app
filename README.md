# challenge app

A system for evaluating students' work to enter and read the results of individual individuals, and then calculate statistics from the results. 
Ratings are entered as floating-point numbers from 0 to 6, and these statistics should show us the grade from A to F calculated from the statistics,
the average, the highest grade, and the lowest of each student. All assessments are recorded in a file with the student's name and surname.
